# thermoelasticity_fem
A Finite Element solver for classical linear thermoelasticity in Python

**Important note**: This repository has just recently been made public. It is largely uncommented, with incomplete 
documentation and possibly still bugged. For now, users are incited to read the example scripts in order to make their 
own. There is a steady-state and two transient examples, showcasing the two available solvers. The mesh used in examples
is described in terms of tagged nodes, surfaces and volumes in the folder data/sandwich.txt

## Latest updates
- Handling of Dirichlet conditions has improved: you can now affect one to a specific DOF, not a whole node. Example
scripts have been updated accordingly.
- Time-varying loads have been introduced for the transient solver. A new example script 'example_transient_2.py' 
showcases that.

## Next developments
- Reduced-order modeling for the transient solver using elastic and thermal modes. This should speed up transient
computations with long time-varying loads.
- Uncertainty modeling: parametric uncertainties for material parameters and nonparametric uncertainties to account for
model uncertainties.

## Installation
Create and/or activate a virtual environment. Clone this repository in the folder of your choosing using:
```
git clone git@github.com:rcapillon/thermoelasticity_fem.git
```
Then, install the package and its dependencies using:
```
cd thermoelasticity_fem/
pip install .
```

## Documentation
The redaction of a scientific documentation is in progress on this repository's 
[wiki](https://github.com/rcapillon/thermoelasticity_fem/wiki). It is incomplete for now. 

## Examples
Sample graphics generated by the two example scripts.
