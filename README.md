# thermoelasticity_fem
A Finite Element solver for classical linear thermoelasticity in Python

**Important note**: This repository has just recently been made public. It is largely uncommented, with incomplete 
documentation and possibly still bugged. For now, users are incited to read the example scripts in order to make their 
own. There is a steady-state, three transient examples, showcasing the four available solvers (steady-state, transient,
transient with reduced-order model and transient with reduced-order model and nonparametric uncertainty modeling). 
The mesh used in examples is described in terms of tagged nodes, surfaces and volumes in the folder data/sandwich.txt

## Latest updates
- Handling of Dirichlet conditions has improved: you can now affect one to a specific DOF, not a whole node. Example
scripts have been updated accordingly.
- Time-varying loads have been introduced for the transient solver. A new example script 'example_transient_2.py' 
showcases that.
- Reduced-order modeling for the transient solver using elastic and thermal modes has been added. A new example script
'example_transient_3.py' showcases that, mimicking the load case of 'example_transient_2.py' and solving much faster.
- Nonparametric uncertainty modeling for transient solver with reduced-order model has been added. A new example script
'example_UQ_1.py' showcases that, mimicking the load case of 'example_transient_2.py' and 'example_transient_3.py'.

## Next developments
- Uncertainty modeling: parametric uncertainties for material parameters.

## Documentation
The redaction of a scientific documentation is in progress on this repository's 
[wiki](https://github.com/rcapillon/thermoelasticity_fem/wiki). It is incomplete for now. 

## Examples
