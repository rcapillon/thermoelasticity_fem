# thermoelasticity_fem
A Finite Element solver for classical linear thermoelasticity in Python

**Important note**: This repository has just recently been made public. It is uncommented, without documentation and 
possibly still bugged. For now, users are incited to read the example scripts in order to make their own. There is a 
steady-state and a transient example, showcasing respectively the two available solvers.
